# Genius Square Interview
For this interview, I have been tasked with creating some sort of simulation or game using Rust's bevy game engine. I will implementing the game "genius square." In this game, you have a 6x6 grid and each player must race to fit all of the pieces onto the board.

## Rules:
- First, a player rolls dice to designate the locations of "blockers." These wooden circular tiles block individual locations in the grid and players must work around them to succeed.
- The game starts once the blockers are in place and players may begin placing the game pieces in any order/position/orientation they see fit. Game pieces must fit within the bounds of the grid and cannot overlap with other pieces or blockers.
- A player wins if they are the first to fit each of the pieces on the board.
